        <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>Soft cut out sugar cookies. Sprinkle with coloured sugar before baking.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>3 3/4 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>Half tablespoon of salt</li>
                <li>1 cup margarine, softened</li>
                <li>1 and a half cups of white sugar</1i>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons of vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>    
            <ol>
                <li>Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together, set aside. In a large bowl, cream together the margarine and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Gradually blend in the sifted ingredients until fully absorbed. Cover dough, and chill for 2 hours.</li>

                <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. On a clean floured surface, roll out small portions of chilled dough to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut out shapes using cookie cutters.</li>

                <li>Bake 6 to 8 minutes in the preheated oven, or until edges are barely brown. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.</li>
